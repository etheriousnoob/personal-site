        <p><strong>still</strong> <em>a wannabe coder</em></p>
        <p>I am currently a Third year engineering student,so i had discontinued this course for as long as a year and here i am.
          <br>Upto this point it feels like this is like a time capsule ,hopefully i fully complete this course.
          <br>Quick update:I increased my typing speed to 70wpm i know it doesnt really make a difference.
          <br>I finished an actual book called 'Power of Now', my first book if comics arent counted.
          <br>I have kinda maintained waking up at 4am,I remember waking up to complete this course and exercise.
          <br>I feel like i have disappointed my past self,cuz i am still fat if not even fatter than i ever was.
          <br>Hopefully i wont be disappointed by my future self(u better complete this course or i will fall on u with all my weight).as for now
          whoever is reading thank you and Sayonara ^-^.
